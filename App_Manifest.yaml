  long_description: "You will run a takoyaki shop.\r

    You are given 5000 yen at the start.\r

    Its goal is to make 30000 yen faster than other shops.\r

    When someone reaches 30000 yen,\r

    the series of markets are once closed.\r

    And then it is reset to 5000 yen and new market starts.\r

    \r

    The cost of one takoyaki is 40 yen and the selling price is 50 yen.\r

    The number of takoyakis sold in a day depends on the weather.\r

    About 500 takoyakis would sell on a sunny day.\r

    About 300 on a cloudy day, and about 100 on a rainy or snowy day.\r

    So you should look carefully at the weather forecast\r

    for the next day before making up your mind\r

    about how many you will make.\r

    Takoyaki does not last long, so all unsold takoyakis are discarded.\r

    \r

    The place of the market is changed every day and\r

    the next is announced at 9:00 a.m.\r

    The takoyaki market opens at 9:00 a.m. every day.\r

    By the opening time, you need to decide how many takoyakis to make.\r

    Please remember to check the weather forecast.\r

    It closes at 6:00 p.m. and the sales are calculated."
